# Extended Kalman Filter for Sensor Networks: Object Location and Tracking

The goal of this work is to study the application of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in sensor networks, through its implementation in the problem of location and tracking of an object. This object moves through a two-dimensional space. To estimate its position over time, we have measurements coming from four sensors.
