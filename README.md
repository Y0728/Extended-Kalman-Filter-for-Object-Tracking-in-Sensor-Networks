# Extended Kalman Filter for Object Tracking in Sensor Networks

The goal of this work is to study the application of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in sensor networks, through its implementation in the problem of object tracking. This object moves through a two-dimensional space. To estimate its position over time, we have measurements coming from four sensors.
